- This skeleton code should be generic enough to run most of the deep learning model in pytorch.
The current skeleton contains code for 2D keypoint prediction given an RGB hand image and is 
runnable.
- The goal of the skeleton code is to have it generic enough such that only some functions need
to be changed to run it on a new problem. The overall structure should stay fix. This allows
for better optimization of workflow and data processing.
- Data dimension convention: On CPU HxWxC. On (staging area of) GPU CxHxW. This is because currently the preprocessing is performed on the CPU, and a lot of libraries require HxWxC. However, pytorch (and TF) use CxHxW.
